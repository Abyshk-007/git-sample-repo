Dear Krishna , I think 3 months notice period is too much for L1 engineers.
 It unbias since none of the companies wait for so long. Most of the companies are looking for immediate joiners.
 As per my experience in span of recent 3 months I got rejected from 8 companies just because of high notice period.
 About the candidate looking for multiple option even after having offer letter from any company is the part of
 human instinct of getting higher package.....Well any human would want to earn more since he / she has invested 
so much in their education and upgrading their skills....they invested to have better career growth.....
