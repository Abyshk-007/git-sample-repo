Three month should be applied to both employer and employee.. 
All company they are rush to make join early but at the same side they want 3 month notice..
 It should have freedom from both end to choose the goal.. If employer want best productivity
 they have to follow proper agile and cross cutting dependency.. 
They are free to choose employee based on their requirements and fit for goal... 
Similar way employee is also free to choose the goal freely in terms of salary, technical growth... 
At the end it should of free path to everyone grow...
